### Hi there 👋🏻

<!--
**JGL/JGL** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
-->
I am a consultant, course leader and artist.

As a consultant, I curate context and design constraints for projects.

1. Curating context: I produce reference material, similar projects and other content that helps put a potential or current project into a wider context.
2. Designing constraints: in order to help a project progress, I create limitations that allow a team to concentrate on a smaller set of challenges and move forward, learning from the process.

I love being a catalyst for learning for both students and clients, helping them to build capacity and enabling them to pass on their knowledge to others. I particularly love thinking about new uses of technology as part of a group and then helping to make those uses happen.

In learning I'm interested in connectivism, threshold concepts, open source and being anti-obfuscatory, or against the obscuring of communication.

Ever since I saw the Wizard of Oz I've been interested in the mechanisms or systems that enable stories to be told or society to function. I am interested in making work that allows for real-time interaction between people, places, stories and objects through the use of technology.

I am currently researching solar-powered computing, the history of weaving and global scale augmented reality sculpture.
