### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**JGL/JGL** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I am an interaction designer and lecturer. I research solar-powered computing, the history of weaving and global scale augmented reality sculpture.

Ever since I saw the Wizard of Oz I've been interested in the mechanisms or systems that enable stories to be told or society to function. I am interested in making work that allows for real-time interaction between people, places, stories and objects through the use of technology.

Since 2019 I've been the Interactive Creative Director at Universal Everything. Watch a presentation about the Every-Body exhibition at Edinburgh's Inspace gallery.

Since 2019 I've been the lead lecturer on the Diploma in Creative Computing at the Creative Computing Institute, Camberwell, University of the Arts London. Watch a presentation from me and the inaugural cohort.

Since 2017 I've been a mentor at Arts Emergency, which aims to increase access to the arts and humanities to young people from disadvantaged backgrounds.

Since 2015 I've been a member of the faculty of Year Here as well as a mentor. Year Here aims to help recent graduates build smart solutions to entrenched social problems.
