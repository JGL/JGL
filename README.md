### Hi there 👋🏻

<!--
**JGL/JGL** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I am an interaction designer and lecturer. I research solar-powered computing, the history of weaving and global scale augmented reality sculpture.

Ever since I saw the Wizard of Oz I've been interested in the mechanisms or systems that enable stories to be told or society to function. I am interested in making work that allows for real-time interaction between people, places, stories and objects through the use of technology.

If you've got a joke, poem, recipe, spell or otherwise, get in touch!
